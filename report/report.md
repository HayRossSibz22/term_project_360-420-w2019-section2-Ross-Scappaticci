Introduction:
	For our project, we have decided to simulate a blackjack table, with a dealer and a player. The cards, hands and choices of both parties will be listed. Casinos play blackjack, or any of their games for that matter, because they are going to make money. The odds are always in their favor, but the player we are creating will learn how to play blackjack as well as he can with the rules and nature of the game. The player will always play the same bet, therefor shuffling each hand does not change any odds. The player will not be counting cards using any system.The simulation will end with the amount of dollars left in the perfect player's wallet, which can be a negative amount. The dealers rules are pretty universal, but for simplicity's sake we will stick the dealer at a 17, hard or soft. This means that the dealer will not be able to hit once they have a 17, even if the hand includes an ace, which can usually be switched to play as a 1. The player will be learning how to play perfectly through a genetic algorithm. This is to mean that the player will be winning the most amount of games possible. The deck will be shuffled after each hand. This won’t change the odds of anything, because the player is betting the same amount each time. The purpose of the program will be to have a player learn the perfect way to play blackjack and see how much money it will end up with. The players name will be Jackson Black.
