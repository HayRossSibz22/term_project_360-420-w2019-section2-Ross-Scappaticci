Introduction:
	For our project, we have decided to simulate a blackjack table, with a dealer and a player. The cards, hands and choices of both parties will be listed. Casinos play blackjack, or any of their games for that matter, because they are going to make money. The odds are always in their favor, but the player we are creating will learn how to play blackjack as well as he can with the rules and nature of the game. The player will always play the same bet, therefor shuffling each hand does not change any odds. The player will not be counting cards using any system.The simulation will end with the amount of dollars left in the perfect player's wallet, which can be a negative amount. The dealers rules are pretty universal, but for simplicity's sake we will stick the dealer at a 17, hard or soft. This means that the dealer will not be able to hit once they have a 17, even if the hand includes an ace, which can usually be switched to play as a 1. The player will be learning how to play perfectly through a genetic algorithm. This is to mean that the player will be winning the most amount of games possible. The deck will be shuffled after each hand. This won’t change the odds of anything, because the player is betting the same amount each time. The purpose of the program will be to have a player learn the perfect way to play blackjack and see how much money it will end up with. The players name will be Jackson Black.
Description of Scientific Model:
We will be using genetic algorithms so Jackson can learn how to play optimally. Presumably, because he is not counting cards or using any betting methods, Jackson’s perfect game will be basic strategy. Once Jackson is as good as he will ever be at blackjack, he will then be tested X amount of times to see how many games he can win or lose.   We will see the change per dollar once he is playing optimally. The house rules, which were only briefly explained in the intro, will include no splitting. At no point will Jackson have the option to split his hand, therefore Jackson’s perfect strategy will be different from the most common basic strategy. Because Jackson is stuck at a certain bet, the cards can be shuffled every hand without any consequences.
	Jackson should be able to determine the best move on any given hand, taking into consideration the two cards he has and the card that the dealer is showing.
